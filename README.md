- You can import the PORTAL unity package by Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package ... in the Unity window tabs.
- Please install SteamVR is installed. The PORTAL unity package already contains it. However, if it does not work, please re-install SteamVR from Untiy Asset Store.
- If SteamVR is successfully installed, Go to Edit -> Project Settomgs -> XR Plug-in Management, and check your Plug-in Provider is OpenVR Loader.
- Next, go to Edit -> Project Settomgs -> XR Plug-in Management -> OpenVR and set the Stereo Rendering Mode as Multi Pass.
- Even if you follow all these steps and still the application doesn't work properly, please contact the authors.
